# TODO_FDA_MVVM_BLOC

Welcome to the TODO_FDA_MVVM_BLOC repository! ðŸŽ‰

## Project Overview

This project showcases a simple yet powerful TODO application built with Flutter. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate best practices in Flutter development, utilizing modern architectural patterns and robust state management techniques.

## Key Features

- **Feature Driven Architecture (FDA)**: This architecture helps in managing files and folders efficiently, making the project highly scalable and organized. Each feature is encapsulated within its own module, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Design Pattern**: By implementing the MVVM design pattern, this project ensures that the code is:
  - **Readable**: Clear separation of UI code from business logic enhances code readability.
  - **Maintainable**: Isolated modules and components make it easier to maintain and update the application.
  - **Reusable**: Components and logic can be reused across different parts of the application or in other projects.

- **Bloc State Management**: Bloc (Business Logic Component) is used to manage the state of the application, providing a predictable and testable state management solution.

- **Local Data Storage**: Utilizes `sqflite` to store data locally on the user's device. In the future, we plan to add support for other local database tools like Hive and ObjectBox, giving the community a variety of options for local data storage.

## Future Enhancements

This is an ongoing project, and we are committed to continuously improving and expanding its functionality. Planned future enhancements include:
- Adding support for additional local database tools (e.g., Hive, ObjectBox).
- Introducing new features and improvements based on community feedback.
- Implementing additional useful tools and techniques to provide a comprehensive resource for Flutter developers.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the Flutter community! Whether it's reporting bugs, suggesting new features, or submitting pull requests, your input is highly valued.
